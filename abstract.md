Chaotic trajectories in kicked black holes

Observations have confirmed that black hole mergers can emit gravitational waves.
For such cases, conservation of momentum dictates that the merged system must move away from its initial position, producing what is  known as a black hole kick.
The black hole can be kicked with velocities up to 3000 km/s, depending on the mass ratio and spin alignment of the bodies.
The behaviour of the kicked black hole depends on the gravitational potential provided by the stars, gas and dark matter of the host galaxy.
In this work we used triaxial galactic potentials to follow the fate of such black holes. 
Our model takes into account the effects of dynamical friction and accretion.
We will show how the settling times (the time it takes to go back at the potential minimum after the kick) depend
on the stellar mass density and what is the influence of the potential triaxiallity to induce stochasticity on the orbits.
We finalize by commenting how these results can impact abundance estimates of active galactic nuclei across cosmic times.
